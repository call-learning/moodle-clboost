    @template theme_clboost/teacherdashboard_menu
    Teacher dashboard, very similar to Fordson teacher dashboard but more in line with
    moodle core.

    Example context (json):
    {
        "nodejson": '{
            "text": "Root of menu",
            "key": "test0",
            "display": true,
            "children": [
                {
                    "text": "Child of menu",
                    "key": "test1",
                    "display": true,
                    "children": []
                }
            ]
        }'
    }
}}
